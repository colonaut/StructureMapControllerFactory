StructureMap.MVC4.ControllerFactory
-----------------------------------
      
This adds a ControllerFactory to the StructureMap.MVC4 DependencySolution which lets you control the envoked controller for your StructureMap MVC4 Internet Application.

The approach is an overworked iplementation of the controller factory from structure map of Arnold Zokas, which is designed for an Integration of RavenDB w/o having to derive the Mvc Controller.
Arnold's approach of triggering RavenDB UoW is implemented in NuGet Packages relying to this one.

For an explanation of his approach look into his blog: http://novuscraft.com/blog/ravendb-unitofwork-and-mvc-revisited

This implementation is built on StructureMap.MVC4 (Web Advanced)

It's strongly recommended to pack the nuspec file and add the package to your solution, rather than reference it, as the package will add only the neccessary files to your solution, which you can then edit.
